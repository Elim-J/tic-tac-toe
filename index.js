//store gameboard as array inside of gameboard object
//store players in objects
//use object to control game flow

//goal: have as little global code as possible
//Rule of thumb: if need ONE of something, use a module. If need MULTIPLE of something, create with factories

//set up HTML
//write JS function to render contents of array (manually fill array for now)
//make functions that allow players to mark to specific spot on board 
//check for game over (3 in a row and tie)
//clean up interface to allow players to add their names
//include start/restart button
//congratz for winning player
//(create AI computer?)
